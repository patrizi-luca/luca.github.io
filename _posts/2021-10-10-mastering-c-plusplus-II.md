## Introduction
Welcome to the second part of "Mastering the C++ Interview," focusing on advanced topics and the intelligent use of smart pointers in C++. 
From multithreading challenges to the latest language features, we'll explore how to tackle more complex scenarios. Are you ready to elevate your C++ expertise?

## Questions:

* **Threads and Multithreading:**
   * How do you implement multithreading in C++?
   * Describe the difference between a thread and a process.

* **Performance and Optimization:**
   * How do you optimize C++ code to improve performance?
   * Discuss the use of const and constexpr in writing efficient code.

* **Solving Complex Problems:**
   * Address a complex problem and explain how you would solve it in C++.
   * How do you handle race conditions in a multithreaded application?

* **C++11/14/17/20 Features:**
   * What are the new features introduced in C++11/14/17/20?
   * How do you use lambda expressions and variadic templates?



## Answers:
### Threads and Multithreading:
#### Multithreading
In C++, multithreading can be implemented using the <thread> header. Here's a simple example demonstrating the creation of a thread:


#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

// Function to be executed by the thread
void threadFunction() {
    std::cout << "Hello from the thread!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create a thread and associate it with the function
    std::thread myThread(threadFunction);

    // Main thread continues its work
    std::cout << "Hello from the main thread!" << std::endl;

    // Wait for the thread to finish its execution
    myThread.join();

    return 0;
}


In this example, a new thread is created using std::thread and associated with the function threadFunction(). The main thread continues its work, and myThread.join() ensures that the main thread waits for the created thread to finish its execution before proceeding.
